# simple-calculator
A web-based calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It performs basic arithmetic operations like Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division with a clean UI and responsive design. This project helped me practice DOM manipulation, event handling, and styling with CSS while keeping the design simple and user-friendly.
